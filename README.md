# Project #2 — Superstore Sales Performance Dashboard

## 🎯 Objective
To create an interactive Power BI dashboard analyzing Superstore sales performance between 2014–2017.  
The dashboard helps visualize key metrics such as sales, profit, discount, and category-wise performance.

## 📊 Dashboard Overview
The **Superstore Sales Performance Dashboard** provides a dynamic view of business performance with:

## 💡 Key Insights
- **Tables and Binders** were the top-performing sub-categories in sales.  
- The **West Region** showed the highest total sales.
